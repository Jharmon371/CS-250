        Course Reflection
  How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program I break the information given into groups depending on the objective, then I would break those groups into sprints.
  How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are written documentation that breaks down the client's requests into more manageable documentation. which helps find the more hidden finite details.
  How do I approach developing programs?
I tend to start with the frame of the program first to leave as much time for the client to add or remove ideas before I spend too much time on the details.
  What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would definitely incorporate the flexibility aspect as in my experience it is always best to test your software at each step of your coding. This helps ensure the smallest margin of errors or bugs.
  What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I would say one of the most important parts of being in a team is communication and doing your part. Without communication it leaves the others in your team with open questions about what you are doing and if you are making any progress. The more you communicate your issues the quicker they will be resolved.
